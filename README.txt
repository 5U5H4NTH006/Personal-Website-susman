## Assumptions Made

3. The site should be primarily informational but with interactive elements
4. Modern browsers with JavaScript enabled are the target environment
5. The site should be lightweight and load quickly

## Execution Instructions

- Navigate using the menu on the left side
- The text analyzer tool requires 10,000+ words of text input
- Visit and click counters are visible in the top-right corner

## Known Issues
